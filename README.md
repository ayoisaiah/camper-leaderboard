# Camper Leaderboard

This is the [second project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard) for freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization certificate.

Completed On: 10 December 2016  
Last Updated: 13 March 2017

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**Rule #3**: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

## User Stories

- I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
- I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
- I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

## Hints

- To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.
- To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
